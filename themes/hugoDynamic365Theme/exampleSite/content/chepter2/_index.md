heading: "Implementing Dynamics 365"
intro: "Planning is important for deploying Dynamics 365. How do you deploy Dynamics 365 in terms of cost schedule scope?
Dynamics 365 requires you to purchase a subscription model license for each user according to the features you need. The 'required functionality' will be clear in the scope of the deployment project.

It is very important to choose the right license for your scope. Monthly payments vary depending on the type of license. In most companies, the required functions (= license) differ depending on the department or job title."
