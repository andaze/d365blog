Do you know Dynamics 365 provided by Microsoft? Microsoft Dynamics 365 is a business application that can integrate and utilize data from each department such as sales, marketing, accounting, general affairs, and human resources.

Previously, it was divided into Dynamics CRM, a product for sales, services, and marketing that requires customer relationship management, and Dynamics AX, NAV, an ERP (Accounting, Supply Chain, Project, and Human Resources Management) product.

Today, we are evolving all of these capabilities into a single application called Dynamics 365, which is a business application that can be used both in the cloud and on-premises.

Microsoft has a strong image of Office products, but it also boasts a high market share in ERP and CRM systems. Before touching on Dynamics 365 as a CRM system in this article, I would like you to first understand the history and necessity of CRM systems.


## What is CRM
- - -
CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. In Japanese, it means customer relationship management. It means a management strategy and management method aimed at increasing the sales and profitability of a company by building, managing and analyzing relationships with customers and improving customer satisfaction.

## CRM systematization

In fact, the word CRM has been around since the 1990s. It was a method that was born from a corporate strategy based on products, with the changing times that place more importance on relationships with society and customers.

CRM was systematized in the 2000s. With the development of technologies such as personal computers and the Internet, the need for systematization has increased in order to collect, analyze, and utilize vast amounts of data. Therefore, we first promoted the introduction of ERP systems such as Microsoft, SAP, and Oracle, centering on consulting firms, and the CRM system was introduced in the form of linking with ERP.

## The value of centralizing information

With the introduction of CRM as a customer management system, customer information will be managed by one system. Then you can see that customer information never comes from one channel. Customer information is added / updated from various channels such as sales activities (diving, business card exchange, calls, introductions, etc.), marketing (seminars, emails, commercials, advertisements, etc.), customer support and services.

Until now, the biggest merit of master management of customer information that was managed by each department or department of the organization with one CRM system is that the person in charge of the department can " understand the current situation of the customer and understand the current situation of the customer. From there, it is possible to accurately grasp " how to act in the future ".

For example, consider the following situation.

### Example: Dealing with existing customers who are dissatisfied with the product

A customer introduced a customer who has been in business for many years and purchased the product as a new customer. However, there is something wrong with the purchased product, so I am in the process of contacting the customer support department to exchange the product. Customers are not a little dissatisfied with the product.

If a sales representative makes an appointment with this customer to introduce a new product, there are some things to check in advance. It is to check the response history in the customer support department and understand the complaints and response status received from customers.

It would be nice if a sales person could check the status with this support person in real time, but what if the support person was absent on the day of the customer visit? An unsuspecting salesperson will not be able to win the hearts of customers without apologizing for product dissatisfaction. Perhaps future transactions themselves will disappear.

If the CRM system manages the "now" of the customer, at least the sales person can check the response status of the support department. That way, sales reps will be better able to determine what to do next.

## Why do you need a CRM system

In the case of the above example, there is an opinion that it would be good if the sales department and the support department could communicate with each other without using the CRM system. That may be true. However, it is easy for mistakes to occur in communication between people. There is a risk that even if you put a memo or sticky note, it will disappear or you will misunderstand what is written.

One way is to manage customer information in Excel and put it in a shared folder so that the person in charge can check it. No complicated settings are required, and information management in the familiar Excel is still used by many companies.

So what's wrong?

### Example: The dilemma between the sales department and the product management department

The sales staff interviewed the sales staff about the detailed information about the customers collected in the sales activities, and all the information was managed in Excel. It describes in detail the basic information of the customer, family structure, hobbies and tastes, business partners and business conditions, and which products are recommended.

On the other hand, the management department managed the products in another Excel. In addition to product names and features, costs and ask prices, and inventory, information about cross-selling and up-selling is managed in detail. The product information is updated every year by the department that develops the product, so the Excel information is updated each time.

Every year during the fiscal year, sales are busy trying to reach their goals. We will make full use of upsell, cross-sell and sale to sell our products one after another. At the same time, the product management department is also busy. This is because it is necessary to constantly update the information from the sales staff, such as checking the inventory of products and adjusting the sale price, and to provide the sales staff with the latest information correctly.

The product management department is preparing to increase the number of staff according to the busy season. However, no matter how much we increase the number of employees, mistakes will always occur in price and inventory management, and the sales department will complain. The sales department also sells products, but due to lack of inventory, it is always necessary to apologize to some customers.

## Information management in Excel is not called management

The above-mentioned events are really common. Information management in Excel is not really management. Inconsistencies occur if information is not mastered , and data inconsistencies always lead to trouble.

Moreover, trouble is not just with customers. In Excel management, even if data is changed or deleted by mistake, the history is not recorded and cannot be recovered, and information leakage due to unauthorized access cannot be prevented. It is indispensable for an organization to supplement the internal control mechanism with a system.

## Which CRM system is recommended

I understand the CRM system that plays a role in managing the relationship between customers, products, employees, and services and various information, and in understanding the "now" and "future" of a company. So which CRM system would you recommend?

The two major CRM systems are Salesforce and Dynamics 365. And here I want to dig deeper into the appeal of Dynamics 365.
