<!-- Intro  -->
In this article, we will learn about Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation (Project Service), an application that can be used like Sales and Customer Service if you have purchased a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan license. If you have purchased a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan license, you can use this application in the same way as Sales and Customer Service, but Project Service is not as popular as Sales.


## What is Project Service Automation?
Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation is an application for managing all project-related tasks, such as estimating the budget required to launch a project, optimizing the company's resources, managing schedules and project progress, and calculating expenses and revenues. The application is designed to manage all project-related tasks in one place. It is a useful application for SIers and manufacturing companies that undertake projects on a project-by-project basis.

In addition, if you install the [Project Service Automation add-in](https://www.microsoft.com/ja-JP/download/details.aspx?id=54299) to your Microsoft Project client, you can manage the WBS of projects created with Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation in your local Project Service Automation. This is quite a useful feature.

*For more information about Dynamics 365 [applications](), please refer to the previous article.

## Structure of Project Service Automation
Before we install it, let's understand the main entities that make up Project Service Automation: In Dynamics 365 for Sales, we had leads, and from there we had business partners and representatives, and sales deals. In Service Automation, a quote is created from a sales case, and once that quote is accepted, a project contract is created. When a quote is accepted, a project contract is created, and project management is initiated by adding the project to the project contract.

A project is related to various entities, such as
<!-- Image= psa-02.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-02 "290" "596" "796" >}}

A project is related to various entities, such as

|       |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Projects | Manage projects |
| Business Partners | Customer information, same as for Sales |
| organizational unit | Organization. Manage your own company, outsourced companies, and foreign departments. |
| Resources | Mainly manage people. Assign users, staff, etc. to projects. |
| Resource Roles | Role, such as PM or programmer |
| Capability Model | Skill level. (e.g.) 3-level rating (beginner - advanced)  |
| Resource Skills | Skills. Skills such as programming and management, qualifications held. |
| Price List | Resource prices. Create separate cost and operating prices. |
| Roll price | Price of rolls; PMs and programmers set cost at XX million, etc. |

The entities mentioned above will be explained in detail when you install and configure Project Service Automation.


## Install Project Service Automation.
If the instance you are building does not have Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation installed, you will need to do this step. Open the [Dynamics 365 Management Center](https://port.crm7.dynamics.com/) and click on "Solutions" for the instance you want to install.
<!-- Image= psa-03.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-03 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Select "Project Service Automation" and click "Install". It will take a few moments for the installation to complete, so please be patient.
<!-- Image= psa-04.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-04 "290" "596" "796" >}}

After the installation is successfully completed, go to the [Dynamics 365 home screen](https://home.dynamics.com/) and click on Project Service Automation (Project Service in version 3) in the list of apps.

## Configuring Project Service Automation
Preconfigure your system to use Project Service Automation. All of this work is for administrators.

### Create roles and skills.
The first step is to create roles, skills, and ability levels. Roles are the roles you will play in the project. Skills are the skills of the project members, and ability levels are their proficiency in those skills.

  * Roll: PM    
    Skills: Project management skills (I am good at it)

  * Role: Programmer     
    Skillsï¼šC# (I am good at it)
      
#### Setting up a capability model     
The competence model represents the level of proficiency in a skill, with three levels of evaluation and years of experience.
Click "Capability Model" from the menu.
<!-- Image= psa-06.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-06 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Since we have a default model, we will rename it to "Proficiency" and save it.
<!-- Image= psa-07.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-07 "290" "596" "796" >}}

#### Configure the skills of the resource.       
Let's define the skills and qualifications that the resource has. Click on "Resource Skills" from the menu.
<!-- Image= psa-08.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-08 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Create a new C# and Project Management skill, respectively.
<!-- Image= psa-09.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-09 "290" "596" "796" >}}

#### Create a role for the resource    
Let's define the role of the resource. Click "Resource Roles" from the menu.
<!-- Image= psa-10.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-10 "290" "596" "796" >}}

By default, "Project Manager" and "Team Member" are provided, so change these to "PM" and "Programmer".
<!-- Image= psa-11.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-11 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Open the role name and rename it. Add the **skills and ability models** you have already created here.
<!-- Image= psa-12.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-12 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Programmers are set up in the same way.
<!-- Image= psa-13.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-13 "290" "596" "796" >}}

### Create an organizational unit.
Once the roles are created, the next step is to set the organizational unit. The organizational unit represents the company or department, but it should be created at **the boundary where the unit price of the work changes**, such as when it varies by country or region, or when external subcontractors participate in the project.

This time, we will create the following two organizational units.
  * DeMo Corporation (in-house)
  * Outsource Company (external cooperation)
  
Open the menu and click Organizational Unit.
<!-- Image= psa-14.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-14 "290" "596" "796" >}}

There is one existing organizational unit (your company), so let's edit the name. No cost setting will be done here.
<!-- Image= psa-15.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-15 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Similarly, create a new external partner company.
<!-- Image= psa-16.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-16 "290" "596" "796" >}}

The organizational unit is now ready. When you create a price list, you will set up this organizational unit or role.

### Create a price list
The next step after the organizational units is to set up the price list. As mentioned in the [Dynamics 365 product catalog](), the price list defines the cost and operating price of a product. For example, if you have a manager, the cost is the price of the manager. (For example, for a manager, the cost price is xxx yen and the list price is ooo yen.

#### Difference between cost and sales      
In the price list, you need to select "Sales" and "Cost" in the field called Context. These have the following differences.

<!-- Box -->
|       |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Sales" is the sales price to be paid to the customer. The entity to which the price list relates is the **client company**.
Cost" is the cost. The entity to which the price list relates is the **organizational unit.** |

The key point is that the entities that can be tied together depend on the price list you create.


#### Add a shipping unit      
The price list can be created in organizational units, but if resources = people, many projects will ship in units of not only hourly rates, but also months per person. Therefore, it is necessary to add a month unit to the Time unit of shipment in advance.

Open the "Shipping Unit List" from the "Product Catalog" in the "Settings" menu, and click "Time".
<!-- Image= psa-17.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-17 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Click "Shipping Units" from the top menu of Time.
<!-- Image= psa-18.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-18 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Here we add Month, and we set Month as 160 Hour (which may be different for each company).
<!-- Image= psa-19.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-19 "290" "596" "796" >}}

#### Create a price list of costs.      
Click "Price List" from the menu.
<!-- Image= psa-20.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-20 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Create a new one. Create a cost price list with the name as your price list. As for the "Start Date" and "End Date", they will be expiration dates, so if, for example, the unit price changes, set them properly. We set Month as the shipping unit we just created and saved it. Now you can set the price per person-month.
<!-- Image= psa-21.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-21 "290" "596" "796" >}}

#### Add a roll price       
Set the price for each roll in the price list created above. Click the "+" button for "Roll Price. Set the cost of PM here.
<!-- Image= psa-22.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-22 "290" "596" "796" >}}

We also set the roll price for the programmer. We now have a price list of our own costs.
<!-- Image= psa-23.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-23 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Similarly, prepare the cost of external subcontractors.
<!-- Image= psa-24.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-24 "290" "596" "796" >}}

#### Create a sales price list.       
Since what we have created above is a price list for costs (cost of goods), we will also create a price list for sales. To make it easy, open the price list and click "Copy".
<!-- Image= psa-25.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-25 "290" "596" "796" >}}

You can copy the price list, so switch the "Context" section to "Sales", update the name, and save it.
<!-- Image= psa-26.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-26 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Now it's time to set the roll price. You will probably want to set a price higher than the cost price here, so set each one accordingly.
<!-- Image= psa-27.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-27 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Make sure to create the same for your external subcontractors. This completes the setup of the price list. Associate the created price list with the organization unit and the client company respectively.
<!-- Image= psa-28.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-28 "290" "596" "796" >}}

### Relate the cost price list to the organizational unit.
Associate the cost price list with the organizational unit. You will now be able to set the price (cost) for the organizational unit. Click "Organization Unit" from the menu to open the organization unit you just created.
<!-- Image= psa-29.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-29 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Set up the organizational units of external subcontractors in the same way.
<!-- Image= psa-30.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-30 "290" "596" "796" >}}

### Associate the sales price list with the companies you do business with.
The next step is to associate the sales price list with the company you are dealing with. By associating the price list with a company, the price list will be inherited by any business negotiations (sales proposals) that occur from that company. Click on "Customer" in the menu to open an existing customer company.
<!-- Image= psa-31.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-31 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Add the price list (sales) that you created in the "Project Price List" section.
<!-- Image= psa-32.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-32 "290" "596" "796" >}}

The association is now complete.

### Create a resource
Finally, we will create resources. Here, we will add the added users of Dynamics 365 and members of external subcontractors as staff. These resources will be assigned to the project later.

#### Resource type     
The types of resources are as follows. You can also create facilities called "equipment", but the basic person is used as a resource and the source of the resource is defined.

|       |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| user | Dynamics 365 users |
| Business partner representative | Dynamics 365 trading partner representative |
| Business Partners | Dynamics 365 trading partners |
| fixtures | Facilities and meeting rooms. |
| Group | Groups of resources |
| general purpose | Other (used when defining project team members) |


&nbsp;

#### Create a resource with a user     
The first step is to create a resource in the Dynamics 365 user. Click "Resources" from the menu.
<!-- Image= psa-33.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-33 "290" "596" "796" >}}

In Add New, add a user with "Resource Type" as User as shown below. Don't forget to set the time zone, and then save the file.
<!-- Image= psa-34.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-34 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Next, let's set the role of the resource and the skill of the resource respectively.
<!-- Image= psa-35.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-35 "290" "596" "796" >}}

You have now created your internal PM resources.

#### Create resources with staff
Let's also add staff from external subcontractors. Open a new window as above. Set the "Resource Type" to "Staff" and set the time zone. The important thing here is to set the "Organization Unit" at the bottom of the screen to External Partner.
<!-- Image= psa-36.png -->
{{< imagedisplay psa-36 "290" "596" "796" >}}

Now you can also create resources for external subcontractors.

## You are ready to manage your project
Now that we are ready to start project management, let's start with creating a project by following the flow to understand Dynamics Project Service Automation. In the next article, I will show you how to [create a sales project from a lead]() in Project Service Automation.

That's all for now.
