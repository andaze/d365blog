Planning is an important part of implementing Dynamics 365. How should we implement Dynamics 365 in terms of cost, schedule and scope?

Dynamics 365 requires the purchase of subscription model licenses on a per-user basis, based on the functionality required." The "required functionality" will become clear in the scope of the deployment project.

It is very important to choose the right license for your scope. The type of license will change the amount you pay each month. In most companies, the required functions (i.e. licenses) differ depending on the department or position.

In this section, we will discuss what you should consider when implementing Dynamics 365.
