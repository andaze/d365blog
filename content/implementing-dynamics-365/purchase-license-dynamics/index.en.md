<!-- Intro  -->
So far, we have been preparing for the implementation of Dynamics 365.

Now that we have a schedule and a rough estimate of the cost, we would like to start using Dynamics 365. The first thing you need to do is to purchase a license. This is very basic, but if you don't purchase a license, you can't proceed.


## Purchase a license for Dynamics 365
First, proceed to purchase a license from the following website.

Dynamics 365 Pricing     
[https://www.microsoft.com/ja-jp/dynamics365/pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ja-jp/pricing/)

When you access the site, you will be taken to the following screen.

{{< imagedisplay accessSite "290" "596" "796" >}}

This time, I'm going to go through the process of purchasing Dynamics 365 Plan 1.
Click the "Purchase" button for Dynamics 365 Plan 1.
<!-- Image= Purchase.png -->
{{< imagedisplay Purchase "290" "596" "796" >}}

This will take you to the user registration screen, where you can register.

If you have already registered your Office 365 account (@xxxx.onmicrosoft.com), click "Sign In" to proceed to the purchase screen.

{{< imagedisplay signIn "290" "596" "796" >}}

Register your account name and password as shown below, and then proceed to [Next] to create your account.
<!-- Image= add-01.png -->
{{< imagedisplay add-01 "290" "596" "796" >}}


You can then purchase a license on the purchase screen.

Determine the number of licenses you need, and click [Next].
<!-- Image= licenses.png -->
{{< imagedisplay licenses "290" "596" "796" >}}


After entering your payment information, place your order and make your purchase.

Once your purchase is complete, go to the next step.

## Access the Office 365 Management Center
After purchase, go to the Office 365 administrator site.

Office 365 Admin center    
[https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage)

You can check the information of the purchased license from "License" in Billing Information.

{{< imagedisplay Billing "290" "596" "796" >}}


Now you need to assign the license to the account that will be using Dynamics 365.
<!-- Image= account.png -->
{{< imagedisplay account "290" "596" "796" >}}

Press "Edit" under "Product License".
<!-- Image= add-02.png -->
{{< imagedisplay add-02 "290" "596" "796" >}}


Turn on your Dynamics 365 license and click Save.
<!-- Image= add-03.png -->
{{< imagedisplay add-03 "290" "596" "796" >}}


Access from the Dynamics 365 admin center

Now you can access Dynamics 365 from the Management Center.
<!-- Image= Management.png -->
{{< imagedisplay Management "290" "596" "796" >}}


Edit the instance in the Dynamics 365 admin center (*the screen says it's already done).
<!-- Imnage= admin.png -->
{{< imagedisplay admin "290" "596" "796" >}}


In this way, you can set the URL of the instance and whether it should be a production environment or a sandbox. It is also possible to set security groups.
<!-- Image= sandbox.png -->
{{< imagedisplay sandbox "290" "596" "796" >}}


The application to be used for the instance (sales, marketing, service, etc.) can be configured from the solution.
<!-- Image= configured.png -->
{{< imagedisplay configured "290" "596" "796" >}}


You can see the applications that have been installed. In this case, the sales and customer service applications are installed. Please install any other solutions you need.

<!-- Image= add-04.png -->
{{< imagedisplay add-04 "290" "596" "796" >}}


When you are ready, try to access Dynamics 365.
<!-- Image= access.png -->
{{< imagedisplay access "290" "596" "796" >}}


The actual Dynamics 365 screen is now displayed.
<!-- Image= screen.png -->
{{< imagedisplay screen "290" "596" "796" >}}


In the next article, I will explain a little about the admin center screen.
