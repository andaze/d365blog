<!-- Intro  -->
So far, we have been preparing for the implementation of Dynamics 365.

Now that we have a schedule and a rough estimate of the cost, we would like to start using Dynamics 365. The first thing you need to do is to purchase a license. This is very basic, but if you don't purchase a license, you can't proceed.


## Purchase a license for Dynamics 365
First, proceed to purchase a license from the following website.

Dynamics 365 Pricing     
[https://www.microsoft.com/ja-jp/dynamics365/pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ja-jp/pricing/)

When you access the site, you will be taken to the following screen.

This time, I'm going to go through the process of purchasing Dynamics 365 Plan 1.
Click the "Purchase" button for Dynamics 365 Plan 1.

This will take you to the user registration screen, where you can register.

If you have already registered your Office 365 account (@xxxx.onmicrosoft.com), click "Sign In" to proceed to the purchase screen.

Register your account name and password as shown below, and then proceed to [Next] to create your account.

You can then purchase a license on the purchase screen.

Determine the number of licenses you need, and click [Next].

After entering your payment information, place your order and make your purchase.

Once your purchase is complete, go to the next step.

## Access the Office 365 Management Center
After purchase, go to the Office 365 administrator site.

Office 365 Admin center    
[https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage)

You can check the information of the purchased license from "License" in Billing Information.

Now you need to assign the license to the account that will be using Dynamics 365.
<!-- Image= account.png -->

Press "Edit" under "Product License".

Turn on your Dynamics 365 license and click Save.

Access from the Dynamics 365 admin center

Now you can access Dynamics 365 from the Management Center.
<!-- Image= Management.png -->
{{< imagedisplay src="Management.png" >}}


Edit the instance in the Dynamics 365 admin center (*the screen says it's already done).
<!-- Imnage= admin.png -->
{{< imagedisplay src="admin.png" >}}


In this way, you can set the URL of the instance and whether it should be a production environment or a sandbox. It is also possible to set security groups.
<!-- Image= sandbox.png -->
{{< imagedisplay src="sandbox.png" >}}


The application to be used for the instance (sales, marketing, service, etc.) can be configured from the solution.
<!-- Image= configured.png -->
{{< imagedisplay src="configured.png" >}}


You can see the applications that have been installed. In this case, the sales and customer service applications are installed. Please install any other solutions you need.

<!-- Image= add-04.png -->
{{< imagedisplay src="add-04.png" >}}


When you are ready, try to access Dynamics 365.
<!-- Image= access.png -->
{{< imagedisplay src="access.png" >}}


The actual Dynamics 365 screen is now displayed.

In the next article, I will explain a little about the admin center screen.
