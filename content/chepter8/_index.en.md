<!-- Intro -->
Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation can be used by system integrators and system development companies that receive and manage projects on a project basis. Project Service Automation manages not only "products" but also "services". Project management can track project progress and costs, and members can report on their own work to accurately manage project resources.

This section provides an introduction to Project Service Automation in general.
