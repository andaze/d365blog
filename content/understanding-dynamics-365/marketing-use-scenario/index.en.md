<!-- Intro  -->
In the [scenario of using Dynamics 365 in sales](), we introduced a scenario of using Dynamics 365 in sales. Now, what would happen if Dynamics 365 is used in marketing? Nowadays, more than sales activities, how to effectively conduct marketing activities to increase the number of potential customers is becoming an indispensable part of a company's survival strategy.

In this scenario, let's take a look at a scenario in which two applications, Dynamics 365 for Sales and Dynamics 365 for Marketing, are used to perform marketing activities.

## When marketers use Dynamics 365

In this scenario, the marketers will be strategically and efficiently increasing their own customer base by conducting events and campaigns to acquire customers and also collaborating with sales.

【The characters in the scenario.】

Sales X      

### 【1】 Leveraging Marketing Campaign Emails with Dynamics 365 for Marketing
Marketer A is preparing for the Dynamics Conference 2018, which is scheduled to take place in three months. The venue is ready and the arrangements with the vendors are going well, but the attendee list is not large enough.

So, Marketer A opens Dynamics 365 for Marketing and creates an email with photos from last year's event and information about the companies participating in the event. The email is easy to create and edit because it has a template and can be created visually.

Now that the design was complete, I set up the campaign email with an "open confirmation" feature so that the marketer would know that the customer had opened the email and clicked on the link about the conference in the email. We then sent out a batch of campaign emails to our entire list of prospective customers.

### 【2】 Create automated campaigns to market to new and existing customers.
Marketer A is very busy. While preparing for the aforementioned event, he also needs to conduct ongoing marketing activities to existing and new customers who are already doing business with his company.

Therefore, we will leverage the automated campaign feature in Dynamics 365 for Marketing to automate campaign activities according to the following scenarios.

* A newsletter is sent at the beginning of each month to the customer's contact record managed in Dynamics 365 for Sales. However, the newsletter will not be sent to customers who have informed us that they do not need it.
* The Dynamics 365 for Marketing feature automatically adds customers who have subscribed to a newsletter you send to your subscriber list.
* To the customers on the subscriber list, marketing emails will be sent during the month, prepared by the marketing department, with information about their products and sales.
* If a marketing email is opened and the URL of a commercial product is clicked, an email will be sent to all marketing staff and to the customer's sales representative.
* If a customer has not subscribed to a marketing email within a month after it was sent, an email is sent to the customer's sales representative, prompting the sales representative to contact the customer.

We have completed the setup of this automated campaign and are working on ways to continue to maintain the relationship with our customers.


### 【3】 Use landing pages to implement effective marketing strategies.
At the Dynamics Conference 2018, which was scheduled in three months, Marketer A was worried that the number of registrations for the seminar was not as high as expected. When he analyzed the landing page of the conference, he found that the description was too long and people left the page without reading it, they didn't know where to register, and they couldn't decide whether to attend the conference because they didn't have an image of past conferences (they couldn't see the benefits). We found out that there were some problems.

We immediately edited the landing page in Dynamics 365 for Marketing, using images and videos instead of text, showing a large button to register, and images of past conference attendees and their conferences.

After a few days, the number of conference applications gradually increased, and the number of new people registering increased.

In addition, we used Dynamics 365 for Marketing's matching strategy to determine if the user viewing the landing page was already registered (i.e., had attended a previous conference), and if so, we encouraged the marketing of a referral campaign to further increase attendance.

 
### 【4】 Transferring prospective customers to sales through integration with Dynamics 365 for Sales
Marketing Manager A used Dynamics 365 for Marketing to increase the number of people who applied to attend the conference even more than last year. After the conference was a great success, we collected surveys about the conference and uploaded the survey information to each lead's information.

Here, Marketing person A has a meeting with Sales person X. We shared information about the leads we generated at the conference, the conversations we had at the conference, whether they were prospects or not, and what kind of surveys they answered.

Now, it's time for Sales X to take advantage of the features of Dynamics 365 for Sales to turn the leads from the conference into potential sales deals and successfully close the deals.

In this way, Dynamics 365 for Marketing, which specializes in marketing, has the functions of a regular MA tool. Furthermore, by seamlessly integrating with Dynamics 365 for Sales, you can realize a series of corporate activities from marketing to sales activities and aftercare (customer service).

If you implement Dynamics 365 in your company, I hope you will be able to imagine which areas you can use it in.
