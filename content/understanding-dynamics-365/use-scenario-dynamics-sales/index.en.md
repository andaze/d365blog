<!-- Intro  -->
The purpose of implementing Dynamics 365 has become clearer, and with the cooperation of each department, we are now able to visualize to some extent the follow-up system after implementation.

Now that the decision to implement Dynamics 365 has been made in the company, you need to convey the image of starting to use Dynamics 365 to your main sales members.

We have already talked about what Dynamics 365 can do, but what would happen if salespeople actually used the features? Can you give us an idea of how sales activities would be carried out?

In this article, I would like to introduce a scenario that focuses on the use of Dynamics 365 in sales activities. The following scenarios are likely to happen in your sales activities. Please try to apply them in your field activities and imagine when you would need CRM.


## In what situations do you use Dynamics 365 in sales?

In this article, I will describe a scenario where Dynamics 365 is used in sales activities. We will use Dynamics 365 for Sales as the application to be implemented, and we hope you will be able to imagine what kind of sales activities you will be able to achieve by using Dynamics 365 functions in that application.

In this scenario, we will follow the following sales activity flow.     

【1】 Lead management (sales activities with prospective customers)   
【2】 Management of prospective customers (from leads to sales deals)    
【3】 Close sales cases and prepare invoices     

【The characters in the scenario.】
* Sales A
* Property owner B

### 【1】 Lead management (sales activities with prospective customers)
At an investment seminar on product Z sponsored by X Corporation, to which salesperson A belongs.

When we confirmed the background of asset owner B's participation in the seminar, he was in a state of "I want to choose product Z for asset management, but what should I do? Therefore, we exchanged business cards and made an appointment with salesperson A to talk about the current industry trends and the merits and demerits of product Z investment on another occasion.

Sales A went back to his company and used Dynamics 365 for Sales to enter his conversation with Asset Manager B and his business card information in the lead information. He also entered the date of the next appointment, which synced the appointment date and meeting place to his calendar. The alert is now set to 30 minutes in advance.

Later, I received a phone call from asset owner B.

So, salesperson A asked the following questions that he couldn't get out of the seminar
* Information about the bank you are financing and the company's business situation
* How much interest rate do you want to invest?
We were able to find out about their needs, such as

I used the memo function of the lead to record these requests, including the content and time of the call and the temperature of Asset Manager B immediately so that I would not forget.

Half an hour before the appointment with asset owner B, salesperson A opens his tablet PC at the meeting place, rechecking what asset owner B was talking about from the lead information in Dynamics 365 and simulating the concept of introducing his company's product Z.

Eventually, asset manager B arrived at the meeting place. We reconfirmed our requirements and introduced our company's product Z. We talked about the advantages and disadvantages of the product, and after 120 minutes of conversation, the day was over.

Asset owner B liked Sales A's presentation so much that he said, "Next time, I'd like to see a simulation of investing in product Z." So he went back to his company, opened his Dynamics lead information and marked this customer as "Prospective. So you go back to your company, open up your Dynamics lead information, and mark this customer as "probable".

### 【2】 Management of prospective customers (from leads to sales deals)
When a lead is identified as a prospect in Dynamics 365, a sales case is automatically created based on the lead's information, including company information, personal information, and the proposed product Z.

Salesperson A records the conversation with Asset Manager B in the sales case and sets the date for the next appointment. Before that, I created a document with the results of a simulation of how much assets will increase in 10 to 30 years if Product Z is invested. As a reminder, I will upload that document as an attachment to the Asset Manager B Company Information in Dynamics 365.

Based on the results of the simulation, I was going to give them a quotation if they were willing to invest in the project, so I created and printed a "Quotation" from the Dynamics 365 sales project. Now we are all ready for the next business meeting.

On the day of the business meeting, Asset Manager B checks the simulations and investment information that Salesperson A prepared. Asset Manager B is determined to invest and asks Salesperson A for a quotation.

When I showed him the estimate I had prepared, Asset Manager B asked, "How much would it cost if I also invested in your other product, X? He asked.

Sales A does not panic, but adds Product X to the proposed products from the Dynamics 365 sales case on his tablet PC and creates the quotation again.

Asset Manager B reviews the quote and decides that he would definitely like to invest in both Product Z and Product X. At a later date, we will set an appointment date for the contract, setting a date when we can complete the necessary documents and preparation of the loan.

Returned to our company and changed the status of the sales project to "Ordered". We prepared the invoice and were ready to sign the contract.


### 【3 】 Close sales cases and prepare invoices
We informed Asset Owner B of the situation regarding the loan, and were able to get his signature on the contract. The contract was signed.
Immediately, Sales A opens the sales case with the status of "Order" in Dynamics 365 and creates an invoice. He prints out the invoice and mails it to Investor B.

A few days later, after confirming the payment from Investor B, Sales A changes the status of the invoice in Dynamics 365 to "Paid". The sales project was closed and one business meeting was completed.


・  ・  ・  ・ 


This was the scenario if Dynamics 365 was used in sales activities from the start of the deal to the close.

In the scenario, the following features of Dynamics 365 for Sales were utilized.      
・ Create leads and manage activities    
・ Functions for linking with calendars and maps    
・ Automatic creation of company and negotiation information from leads     
・ Preparing quotations and invoices from sales projects      

If this is a scenario where you are using Dynamics 365 for Customer Service, you might want to consider this as a "support case.
If you are using Dynamics 365 for Customer Service after this scenario, you may want to pass on the after-sales care of asset owner B to a member of the customer support team as a "support case".

Each company has its own sales style and products to handle.
Based on your own sales activities, try to create a scenario of what your sales activities would be like if you used Dynamics 365. Please create a scenario.
