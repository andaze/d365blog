<!-- Intro -->
In the previous article, I have explained [why I recommend Dynamics 365 as a CRM system](). In that article, I mentioned some of the applications available in Dynamics 365. In this section, I will introduce each application, starting from the sales support system to marketing, support services, project management, and human resources.

## Sales support with Dynamics 365 for Sales

## Improving Customer Satisfaction with Dynamics 365 for Customer Service
**Dynamics 365 for Customer Service** can be used in customer support departments such as customer support and helpdesk. In order to improve the responsiveness, speed, and support quality of the support department, each inquiry from a customer or internal company is managed as a support case, and the details of the phenomenon, cause, and solution are recorded as a ticket (SR: Service Request). As the number of customer support cases increases and tickets accumulate, they become past cases and company assets. Utilizing these case studies will help close the gap in skills and knowledge of support members, and maintain and improve the quality of support services.

It also makes it easy to analyze the current status of the support department and formulate strategies for quality improvement, such as improving response time of the support department, selecting skill sets necessary for service improvement, training new support members based on case studies, and improving service delivery according to the source of the inquiry, by categorizing support cases in terms of time to resolution, customer satisfaction, and importance of the problem.

## Dynamics 365 for Field Service is used in manufacturing and field service
**Dynamics 365 for Field Service** is an application that can be used in the manufacturing industry for "Monozukuri" (manufacturing), for dispatching technicians for maintenance and breakdown of various electronic devices such as home appliances and computers, and for dispatching drivers for transportation services at inns and hotels. This is an application used in the field of field service. For example, a company that provides tractors used by farmers can use this application to dispatch the closest technician to the site to repair the tractor upon receiving a report of a breakdown, or to accumulate all the data on the manufacturing process to greatly reduce the cost of manufacturing.

Since Dynamics 365 for Field Service can automate scheduling, it can show the daily schedule of all technicians and automatically schedule them to handle a large number of projects with minimum travel time. Technicians will be able to work efficiently throughout the day according to that schedule.

In addition, when the technicians travel to the site, they can use their mobile devices to provide route guidance and visit the customer site on time. Furthermore, by sharing information about the customers they have served (preferences and responses) among the technicians, they can provide higher quality services. With Dynamics 365 for Field Service, you can make the best use of your technicians' resources to provide services that suit your customers and increase the repeat rate of your services.

In conjunction with IoT, it will be possible to know exactly when the products provided to customers need maintenance and whether there are any problems or malfunctions. In addition, mixed reality will allow highly skilled technicians to remotely solve problems for customers in different areas.

## Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation Manage project resources and schedules
**Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation** is an application for managing projects in various industries, including IT projects where IT consultants and SIers are selling and implementing their own systems and packages. It can be used for IT projects, including projects where IT consultants and SIers are selling and implementing their own system packages.

Dynamics 365 for Project Service Automation uses the same information as Sales, such as leads, company and customer information, contracts, invoices, etc., to track projects as they are awarded, as well as to manage the resources and skills required for projects. In addition, you can manage the resources and skills required for the project, as well as the schedules and tasks of project managers and technicians. By linking with Microsoft Project, you can create a WBS on the client terminal and synchronize the WBS with the project in Dynamics 365, which will greatly improve your work efficiency.

In addition to your own members, you can also add external subcontractors as resources and manage their costs and operating prices separately, so you can easily calculate profit margins and estimates for each project. Of course, travel and accommodation expenses for engineers dispatched to distant locations can also be managed as part of the project budget. In this way, you can estimate the budget required for a project, optimize your own resources, manage schedules and project progress, calculate expenses and profits, and manage all project-related tasks in one place.
