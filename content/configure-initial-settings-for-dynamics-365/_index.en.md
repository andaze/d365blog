<!-- Intro -->
Once you have installed Dynamics 365, you will need to perform the following initial settings to ensure a pleasant experience.

* System administration
* Adding a user
* Organization settings (Department / Supervisor)
* Security Settings
* Application Settings
* Importing data (Business partner companies, business partner personnel)

In this section, we will introduce the setup immediately after Dynamics 365 implementation. Please keep in mind that most of the work will be performed by the system administrator.
